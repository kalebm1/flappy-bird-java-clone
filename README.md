# Flappy Bird Java Clone
Flappy Bird Clone in Java

### Mission: To learn more about game logic in Java

## What I Learned
I learned to create JFrame windows, set them to not resize, and how to translate my experience in p5.js graphics to Java game graphics.

# How To Play:
  When you download the .jar file, you can run the game to see the start screen.
  To play the game, click the game to start and continue clicking to make the bird
  jump through the columns as they move towards you. Click to make the bird jump through
  the columns. If the bird hits a column, the game is over. Click again to restart
  the game. Try to get the highest score you can!
